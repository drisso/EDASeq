Title: Exploratory Data Analysis and Normalization for RNA-Seq
Description: Numerical and graphical summaries of RNA-Seq read data.
        Within-lane normalization procedures to adjust for GC-content
        effect (or other gene-level effects) on read counts: loess
        robust local regression, global-scaling, and full-quantile
        normalization (Risso et al., 2011). Between-lane normalization
        procedures to adjust for distributional differences between
        lanes (e.g., sequencing depth): global-scaling and
        full-quantile normalization (Bullard et al., 2010).
